![MeshKeeper][1]
==========

Description
-----------

**MeshKeeper** is a platform of services that allow Java applications to discover,
launch, coordinate, and control remote processes across a grid of computers.
    
A [MeshKeeper deployment][3] consists a control server and multiple launch agents. 
A deployment can scale up to any number of computers on a cloud or grid or it 
can scale down to just running wholly embedded in your Java application.
