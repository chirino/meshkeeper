  Overview
  ========
  
  It is easy to embed the MeshKeeper server side services into your application.
  This feature is extremely useful when you are in development mode to avoid having
  to setup all the server infrastructure. 
  
  Using Java
  ==========
  
  With just a few lines of java code, you can get it all going:
  
:raw
  {coderay::java}
  File directory = new File("target/data");
  String registry = "zk:tcp://localhost:2101";
  server = MeshKeeperFactory.createControlServer(registry, directory);
  meshKeeper = MeshKeeperFactory.createMeshKeeper(registry, directory);
  agent = MeshKeeperFactory.createAgent(meshKeeper, directory);
  {coderay}   

:markdown
  Once the above runs, you will have a deployment similar to to the diagram bellow.  
  Your application should use the `meshKeeper` object to access the distributed services
  like remote process launching.

  But Spring Is More Flexible
  ===========================
   
  While starting up everything in Java is very easy, We recommend that spring 
  be used to to create the objects for you.  This gives you the flexibility to switch
  you application between the embedded and distributed modes with just some configuration changes:
  
  The following listing shows you the spring bean configurations needed to start up 
  the the MeshKeeper server services.
  
.div{:style=>"font-size:100%;"}
  :raw
    {coderay::xml}
    <bean id="server" class="org.fusesource.meshkeeper.control.ControlServer"
      init-method="start" destroy-method="destroy">
      <property name="directory" value="control-data" />
      <property name="registryUri" value="zk:tcp://localhost:2101" />
    </bean>

    <bean id="meshKeeper" class="org.fusesource.meshkeeper.spring.MeshKeeperFactory">
      <property name="registryUri" value="zk:tcp://localhost:2101" />
      <property name="directory" value="client-data" />
    </bean>

    <bean id="agent" class="org.fusesource.meshkeeper.launcher.LaunchAgent"
      depends-on="meshkeeper" init-method="start" destroy-method="stop">
      <property name="meshKeeper" ref="meshkeeper" />
      <property name="directory" value="launcher-data" />
    </bean>
    {coderay}

  Next Steps
  ===========================
  
  Now that you know how to start up the MeshKeeper services in your Java Application, perhaps you 
  want to use some of them like [Launching a Remote Process][1] or access a remote process via 
  [Remoting][2] or [Eventing][3].
  with a remote process.
